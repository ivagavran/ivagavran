👋 Hi, I’m Iva Gavran
👀 I’m a computer engineer interested in computer science, psychology and everything related to human evolution and sci-fi.
🌱 During my university education, I worked on various projects using languages and technologies like C, C++, C#, Java, Kotlin, VHDL, SQL, CSS, HTML, XML, UML, Python.
💞️ I spend my free time hanging out with my best friend, reading, traveling or (sometimes) working out (I'm a wannabe athletic person -> I really want to be athletic, 
but my ability to find an excuse every time I need to hit the gym is unsurpassed. ^_^)
